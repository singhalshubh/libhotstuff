The purpose of this letter is to express my interest in working with you at TSC as a Software Engineer. With my experience and background, I wish to make a valuable contribution to the development and would like to work with your intriguing team culture.


I am presently (fourth semester) pursuing MS in CS at University of Pennsylvania with a GPA : 4.0/4.0 (graduating by Dec 2022). My undergraduate honours was with CGPA : 9.49/10 in Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India.



Master's thesis under Dr. Boon Thau Loo: Any Geo-Distributed data center application right now deals with a centralized master controller for job scheduling, task placement and progress report from every data center. Rather a better solution is to have a distributed controller system such that every data center has a controller. This approach ensures regulatory constraints of data movement, coordinated scheduling etc., which has not been studied yet wrt to fault tolerance of the system i.e. master and DC failure. (incorporated hybrid RDMA over RPC for one-sided communication).



HPC dev: Worked at OCaml Labs as SDE. (more details in CV).



Recommendations (available on request) : 
Boon Thau Loo (Associate Dean of UPenn Engineering, Director of DSL Labs)
Linh Phan (Associate Professor at UPenn)
Laura Orsetti (Director of UPenn Online Engineering)

Software Interests : Distributed Computing, Parallel Programming, Operating Systems, Networks, HPC.


I have enclosed my CV for your kind interest.

Thank you for your consideration. Hope to hear from you soon. 


Thanking you, 
Yours Sincerely,
